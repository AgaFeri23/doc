If you are here, then you have definitely installed Marzneshin and Marznode!

Without further ado, let's get into how to use Marzneshin professionally, but first, we need to cover a few topics.

### Using SSL and Domain

Make sure that GFW has the very simple ability to detect all the information exchanged between the client and the server. So the best thing for you is to use SSL, which not only increases the security of your users against phishing attacks but also helps you avoid early filtering.

  Note that Marzneshin is a proxy manager panel and is different from proxies like v2ray, xray, sing box, etc. Any filtering issues are either due to your negligence, increased filtering intensity, or issues with the proxy code itself. The panel is as up-to-date as possible, and you can be sure that there is no problem from Marzneshin's side, and if there is, it will be resolved quickly.

### Multi Admin

Marzneshin has the ability to create admins with different access levels and specify usage limits, etc.

  Please do not use .env to specify the sudo admin (admin with full access).

### Using Various Cores

Marzneshin can use multiple cores through Marznodes such as:

- sing-box
- xray
- v2ray

Each of these cores has its own features, which we will discuss in a separate article.
